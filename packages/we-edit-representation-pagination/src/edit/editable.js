/**
 *  it's a very complicated job, so we need a very simple design, one sentence described solution. options:
 *  1. remove all composed, and re-compose all
 *  	- need find a time to recompose
 *  	- logic is most simple
 *  	- performance is most bad
 *
 *  2. remove all composed from this content, and re-compose removals
 *  	- Need locate composed of this content in page
 *  	- Need find a time to recompose
 *  		> componentDidUpdate
 *  			. any state update,
 *  			. and carefully tuned shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext)
 *  	- performance is better than #1
 *
 *  3. recompose this content, and check if new composed fits last composed space (hit ratio is low)
 *  	- Yes: just replace
 *  	- No: #1, or #2
 *  	- and then loop with all following content with the same logic
 *
 *  	3.a: recompose this content line by line ..., much logics here
